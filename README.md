SGO: Sistema de Gesti√≥n de Operaciones
This is the README.md file for the SGO project.

<br>

Project Overview
This project is a full-stack web application designed to digitize and automate the operational management of a 32-person cleaning and hygiene team at a hospital. The system replaces a manual, paper-based workflow with a modern, cloud-native solution, allowing supervisors to manage daily staff scheduling, log incidents, and plan overtime from any device.

The core of the project is a robust backend API that communicates with a cloud database and a user-friendly frontend interface built for daily operational use. The final output of the system is the automated generation of official administrative forms, significantly reducing manual data entry and planning time.

Key Features
üìã Daily Incident Logging: Supervisors can log daily attendance for each worker across three shifts (Matutino, Vespertino, Nocturno) using a "roll call" style interface.

üîÑ Substitution Planning: A dedicated dashboard allows for the planning and logging of worker-to-worker substitutions.

‚ûï Overtime Management: A comprehensive planning dashboard shows upcoming coverage needs and allows for the assignment and tracking of overtime. Includes a feature to delete assignments.

üìç Daily Service Assignment: An interface for assigning specific service areas to each worker on a daily, per-shift basis.

üìÑ Automated Reporting: A feature to generate and download clean, structured Excel reports for all major data types (incidents, substitutions, assignments, etc.) directly from the application.

üîê Secure User Authentication: A simple but effective sign-in system restricts access to authorized supervisors.

üß† Smart Scheduling Logic: The application contains complex, rule-based logic to accurately filter and display employee lists based on their unique schedules, including day shifts, "work-one, rest-one" night shifts, and special accumulated weekend shifts.

What I Learned
This project served as a practical application of junior data science and cloud engineering skills, covering the entire lifecycle of a full-stack application. Key skills developed include:

Cloud Infrastructure: Provisioning and managing cloud resources (Cloud SQL, Cloud Run) using the gcloud CLI.

Backend Development: Building a robust, data-driven REST API with FastAPI and SQLAlchemy.

Database Design: Modeling a relational database schema to fit complex business requirements.

Containerization: Using Docker to create reproducible environments for both the backend and frontend, and managing images with Artifact Registry.

Frontend Development: Creating a functional and interactive user interface for data entry and visualization with Streamlit.

Automation: Writing Python scripts with pandas and openpyxl to automate the generation of official administrative reports.

Debugging: Systematically diagnosing and fixing a wide range of issues, from local environment problems to complex cloud deployment errors and business logic flaws.
